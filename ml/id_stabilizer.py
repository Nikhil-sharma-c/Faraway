id_stabilizer.py -- temporal identity stabiliser.

Binds a recognised identity to a SPATIAL track and holds it across momentary
recognition failures, so a continuously-present enrolled person never flickers
to UNKNOWN because of one bad frame (motion blur, glasses glare, a hard head
turn, a dropped identification pass).

Why this exists
---------------
Face recognition runs per frame and is noisy: the same enrolled face scores
above threshold on most frames but occasionally dips or is missed entirely.
Deciding "known vs unknown" independently every frame turns that noise into a
stream of false "unregistered person entered / departed" events. Here each
observed face is matched to a persistent track, and the track's identity is
STICKY:

  * CONFIRM-ONCE, THEN HOLD FOR THE LIFE OF THE TRACK. The FIRST time a track
    matches an enrolled id it is CONFIRMED, and it stays committed to that
    identity for as long as the track keeps being observed -- i.e. until the
    person genuinely leaves frame and the track is pruned (TRACK_STALE_S).
    A confirmed track does NOT revert to "identifying" after some timeout: a
    momentary recognition miss, or even a long run of misses while the person
    stands still, is invisible. Re-verification happens continuously and
    quietly in the background -- every confident per-frame match refreshes the
    identity -- but only a GENUINELY DIFFERENT confident identity (a different
    person on the same spatial track) or the track going stale ever changes
    the committed identity. This is what stops the on-video tag cycling
    "confirmed -> IDENTIFYING... -> confirmed" for someone who never left.
  * A track that has NEVER been identified is only reported as UNKNOWN after it
    has persisted unmatched for NEW_UNKNOWN_DWELL_S -- a face flashing past in
    the background does not immediately raise a critical alert, and a
    genuinely new person still goes through the "IDENTIFYING..." (pending)
    state exactly once before being confirmed.
  * Severity scales with how long an unknown track has genuinely persisted.

Pure python (standard library only) so the logic is unit-testable without a
camera or any of the vision models. See test at the bottom / tests/ script.
